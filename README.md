## OHSU Impact Challenge

**Your work and research deserves attention. However, gaining an audience requires strategy and communication skills. The Impact Challenge Workshop series bridges the gap between producing and sharing scholarship.**

In this repository you will find slides, exercises and other materials from Oregon Health & Science University Library's Impact Challenge Workshop series. The materials are designed to help students and early career faculty learn strategies for sharing, promoting and discussing their scientific interests and research. Workshop materials will be added as they become available.
