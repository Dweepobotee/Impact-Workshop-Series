## The Science of Social Media: How to Tweet Like Neil deGrasse Tyson

Most of us use social media, but many do not leverage it for professional success. Twitter is a powerful tool for science outreach and idea development because it can move conversations from an office or lab to a large network of experts and advocates.

In “The Science of Social Media: How to Tweet Like Neil deGrasse Tyson,” we’ll help you create a professional Twitter profile and develop an engagement plan that’s useful and fun!  The session will include a panel discussion with students/social media experts about using Twitter to build a network and discuss issues you’re passionate about.
