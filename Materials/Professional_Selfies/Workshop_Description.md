## Professional Selfies:  Bios & Headshots for Your Academic Self 

A professional headshot and bio are necessary components of an online (or print)
profile.  Good ones make you approachable, communicate interests, and
establish expertise.  In this session, all attendees will create a
bio they can use in a variety of contexts.  The first 50 registered
student and postdoc attendees will receive a free headshot, though the workshop
is open to all.
